# Introduction

Every microservice in the Godspeed framework has three fundamental abstractions, and the developer needs to work with just these three.

## Guiding principles of design

### Three fundamental abstractions
Every microservice in the Godspeed framework has three fundamental abstractions, and the developer needs to work with just these three.

- **Event-sources:** In the Godspeed framework, Event Sources serve as a mechanism for defining the primary entry or initiation points of an application. For instance, you can opt for an 'express' type of Event Source to expose your application through REST APIs, or you may choose a 'cron' type Event Source to schedule recurring calls to specific workflows. This level of configurability empowers developers to finely tune the behavior of their application according to their requirements.

  - **Events:** Events trigger workflows. Events are generated by event sources like REST endpoints, gRPC, message bus, webhooks, websockets, S3, and more...

- **Workflows:** Workflows are triggered by events. They not only perform business logic but also provide orchestration over datasources and microservices, and data/API federation. They will use datasources to store or retrieve data, join across various datasources, transform data, emit events and send responses. The framework provides a YAML dsl with some inbuilt workflows. If YAML does not suffice for any particular case, developers can currently put JS/TS workflows alongside YAML workflows and use them. Coming in future: Support for other languages.

- **Datasources:** Datasources are locations where data can be stored or read from. For example API datasource (another microservice or third party), datastores (RDBMS, document, key-value), file system, S3 storage, etc. A microservice can use multiple datasources. The framework provides abstractions for Authn/Authz making it easy for the developer to express the same in a low code manner.


## Developer's work 
The developer will utilize the framework's CLI to initiate a new microservice project and begin development. They will set up the necessary events, data sources, workflows, and configurations such as mappings, environment variables, and telemetry settings. When configuring data sources:

- For databases, they can either define the database schema or auto-generate it from the existing database using the CLI.

- When using axios plugin for APIs we can specify either OpenAPI schema or provide the corresponding URL.


### Design principles

- **Standardization:** "Godspeed offers standardization features that allow you to seamlessly integrate a wide range of event sources without the need to modify the entire event structure. The only change required is the initial line of the event, and the framework will handle the rest, ensuring a unified event structure across all sources."


### Salient Features

:::tip Note
Some of the features mentioned here are in the product roadmap and planned for upcoming releases.
:::

**Schema driven development**

To initiate development, the developer needs to define the API and data schema.

**YAML based DSL and configurations**

Our YAML-based DSL simplifies the expression of policies, business logic, and configurations. It results in shorter and more comprehensible code compared to traditional programming, even for beginners. Developers can further customize this DSL to accommodate specific requirements.

**Multi datastore support**

The model configuration and unified CRUD API, which includes full-text search and autosuggest, offer interfaces to various types of datastores, whether SQL or NoSQL. This API is designed to handle validation, relationship management, transactions, denormalization, and multilingual support. Each integration adapts to the specific functionality required based on the nature of the data store.  


**Data validation**

The framework offers validation for third-party API requests and responses, datastore queries, and its own API endpoints. Developers are only required to define the schema for third-party APIs, their microservice APIs, and datastore models. The framework handles the rest. For more intricate validation scenarios, such as conditional validation based on attributes like subject, object, environment, or payload, developers can incorporate these rules into the application logic as part of the workflows.

**Authentication**

The microservice framework performs authentication on all incoming requests, extracting user roles and additional information from a valid JWT token for further processing. The platform allows integration with an IAM provider like ORY Kratos to provide identity services. This IAM provider generates a JWT token containing user ID, user information, and roles, which is utilized by the microservices to validate users.

**Authorization** **(`Planned`)**

Each microservice handles the authorization process for incoming requests. Developers will define authorization rules for each microservice using straightforward configuration files. These rules encompass not only access to API endpoints but also provide fine-grained data access within datastores. The framework allows seamless integration with third-party authorization services through flexible abstractions.

**Distributed transactions** **(`Planned`)**

Each domainâ€™s orchestrator is able to use the Saga [pattern](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/saga-pattern-microservices) to ensure distributed transactions across multiple microservices.


**Autogenerated documentation**

The framework provides autogenerated documentation using CLI.

**Autogenerated CRUD API** **(`Planned`)**

The framework provides autogenereated CRUD APIs from database model. Generated API's can be extended by the developers as per their needs.


**Multiple languages support**

If YAML isn't sufficient to address a specific scenario, developers have the flexibility to create custom business logic in their language of choice. If they opt for JavaScript or TypeScript, they can conveniently include the code within the same microservice project. Support for other languages will follow the same approach and is part of our future plans.
