# Context Mentions

Context mentions are a powerful way to provide Saarthi with specific information about your project, allowing it to perform tasks more accurately and efficiently. You can use mentions to refer to files, folders, problems, and Git commits. Context mentions start with the `@` symbol.

| **Problems** | `@problems` | Includes VS Code Problems panel diagnostics | "@problems Fix all errors in my code" |
| **Terminal** | `@terminal` | Includes recent terminal command and output | "Fix the errors shown in @terminal" |
| **Git Commit** | `@a1b2c3d` | References specific commit by hash | "What changed in commit @a1b2c3d?" |

## How to Use Mentions

1. Type `@` in the chat input to trigger the suggestions dropdown
2. Continue typing to filter suggestions or use arrow keys to navigate
3. Select with Enter key or mouse click
4. Combine multiple mentions in a request: "Fix @problems in @/src/component.ts"

The dropdown automatically suggests:
- Recently opened files
- Visible folders
- Recent git commits
- Special keywords (`problems`, `terminal`, `git-changes`)
- **All currently open files** (regardless of ignore settings or directory filters)

The dropdown automatically filters out common directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, and `out` to reduce noise, even though their content could be included if manually typed.

## Important Behaviors

### Ignore File Interactions

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **`.saarthiignore` bypass** | File and folder `@mentions` bypass `.saarthiignore` checks when fetching content for context. Content from ignored files will be included if directly mentioned. |
| **`.gitignore` bypass** | Similarly, file and folder `@mentions` do not respect `.gitignore` rules when fetching content. |
| **Git command respect** | Git-related mentions (`@git-changes`, `@commit-hash`) do respect `.gitignore` since they rely on Git commands. |
