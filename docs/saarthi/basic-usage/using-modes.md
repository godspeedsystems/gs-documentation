# Agents and Modes

Agents in Saarthi are specialized personas that tailor the assistant's behavior to your current task. Each mode offers different capabilities, expertise, and access levels to help you accomplish specific goals.

:::info Sticky Models
Each agent or remembers your last-used model. When switching modes, Saarthi automatically selects that model‚Äîno manual selection needed. Assign different models to different modes (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Preview for `üèóÔ∏è Architect` mode, Claude Sonnet 3.7 for `üíª Code` mode) and Saarthi will switch models automatically when you change modes.
:::

## Why Use Different Modes?

- **Task specialization:** Get precisely the type of assistance you need for your current task
- **Safety controls:** Prevent unintended file modifications when focusing on planning or learning
- **Focused interactions:** Receive responses optimized for your current activity
- **Workflow optimization:** Seamlessly transition between planning, implementing, debugging, and learning

## Switching Between Modes

Four ways to switch modes:

1. **Dropdown menu:** Click the selector to the left of the chat input
   
2. **Slash command:** Type `/<mode-name>` in the chat input
   
3. **Toggle command/Keyboard shortcut:** Use the keyboard shortcut below, applicable to your operating system. Each press cycles through the available modes in sequence, wrapping back to the first mode after reaching the end.
       
    | Operating System | Shortcut |
    |------------------|----------|
    | macOS | ‚åò + . |
    | Windows | Ctrl + . |
    | Linux | Ctrl + . |

4. **Accept suggestions:** Click on mode switch suggestions that Saarthi offers when appropriate

### Activate Code-Godspeed Mode

**Code-Godspeed Mode** enables **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** powered by your codebase, docs, and the **Godspeed Systems framework** ‚Äî delivering **production-grade microservices with embedded best practices and architectural guardrails**.

### Connect to the RAG-node MCP Server

To use this mode:

1. Open Saarthi‚Äôs **MCP Settings** (top-right of Saarthi pane).
2. Scroll down and click:
   * **Edit Global MCP** ‚Üí Opens global `mcp_settings.json`.
3. Add your **Gemini API key** under the `env` block of the RAG-node server config:

```json
"RAG-node": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
    "-y",
    "@godspeedsystems/rag-node"
    ],
    "disabled": false,
    "cwd": "/path/to/home/directory",
    "alwaysAllow": [

üîó [Get your Gemini API Key](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### What Happens Next?

Once connected:

* Saarthi uses `mcp.handle-query` to forward your queries to the **RAG-node**.
* The node uses **FAISS vector search** + **Gemini embeddings** to:
  * Retrieve precise, source-traceable information.
  * Auto-generate config, functions, events, and workflows.
  * Provide *real-time guidance* aligned with Godspeed's architecture.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Currently supports only Google Gemini for embeddings.*

## Customizing Modes

Tailor Saarthi's behavior by customizing existing modes or creating new specialized assistants. Define tool access, file permissions, and behavior instructions to enforce team standards or create purpose-specific assistants. See [Custom Modes documentation](../features/custom-modes) for setup instructions.
