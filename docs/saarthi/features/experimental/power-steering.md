# Power Steering (Experimental Feature)

The "Power Steering" experimental feature (`POWER_STEERING`) is designed to enhance the consistency of Saarthi's responses by more frequently reminding the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) about its current mode definition and any custom instructions.

## How It Works

When Power Steering is enabled, Saarthi constantly reinforces the LLM's understanding of its assigned role (e.g., "You are a helpful coding assistant") and any specific guidelines provided by the user (e.g., "Always provide code examples in Python").

This is achieved by explicitly including the `modeDetails.roleDefinition` and `modeDetails.customInstructions` within the information sent to the LLM with each interaction.

**Goal:**
The primary goal is to ensure the LLM adheres more strictly to its defined persona and follows user-specific instructions more consistently. If you find Saarthi deviating from its role or overlooking custom rules, Power Steering can help maintain its focus.

**Trade-off:**
These frequent reminders consume additional tokens in each message sent to the LLM. This means:
*   Increased token usage per message.
*   Potentially higher operational costs.
*   The context window may be filled more quickly.

It's a balance between stricter adherence to instructions and resource consumption.

**Default Status:** Disabled.

## Technical Details

*   **Experiment ID:** `powerSteering`
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The feature's status is checked by the `getEnvironmentDetails` function.
    *   If enabled, the current mode's `roleDefinition` and `customInstructions` are added to the details sent to the LLM.
    *   These details are wrapped in `<environment_details>` tags and become part of the context for each LLM interaction.
*   **Impact:** By frequently including the role definition and custom instructions, the LLM is steered to generate responses more aligned with these parameters.

## Enabling This Feature

Power Steering is managed within the "Experimental Features" section of Saarthi's Advanced Settings.

1.  Open Saarthi settings (<Codicon name="gear" /> icon in the top right corner).
2.  Navigate to "Advanced Settings".
3.  Locate the "Experimental Features" area.
4.  Toggle the "Power Steering" option.
5.  Save your changes.
