# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Saarthi's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. MCP servers provide additional tools and resources that help Saarthi accomplish tasks beyond its built-in capabilities, such as accessing databases, custom APIs, and specialized functionality.

## MCP Documentation

This documentation is organized into several sections:

* [**Using MCP in Saarthi**](/saarthi/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-saarthi) - Comprehensive guide to configuring, enabling, and managing MCP servers with Saarthi. Includes server settings, tool approval, and troubleshooting.

* [**What is MCP?**](/saarthi/features/mcp/what-is-mcp) - Clear explanation of the Model Context Protocol, its client-server architecture, and how it enables AI systems to interact with external tools.

* [**STDIO, Streamable HTTP & SSE Transports**](/saarthi/features/mcp/server-transports) - Detailed comparison of local (STDIO) and remote (Streamable HTTP & legacy SSE) transport mechanisms with deployment considerations for each approach.

* [**MCP vs API**](/saarthi/features/mcp/mcp-vs-api) - Analysis of the fundamental distinction between MCP and REST APIs, explaining how they operate at different layers of abstraction for AI systems.

* [**Recommended MCP Servers**](/saarthi/features/mcp/recommended-mcp-servers) - Curated list of tested and recommended MCP servers for Saarthi, including a setup guide for Context7.
