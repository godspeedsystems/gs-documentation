# Recommended MCP Servers

While Saarthi can connect to any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that follows the specification, the community has already built several high-quality servers that work out-of-the-box. This page curates the servers we **actively recommend** and provides step-by-step setup instructions so you can get productive in minutes.

> We'll keep this list up-to-date. If you maintain a server you'd like us to consider, please open a pull-request.

## Context7

`Context7` is our first-choice general-purpose MCP server. It ships a collection of highly-requested tools, installs with a single command, and has excellent support across every major editor that speaks MCP.

### Why we recommend Context7

* **One-command install** – everything is bundled, no local build step.
* **Cross-platform** – runs on macOS, Windows, Linux, or inside Docker.
* **Actively maintained** – frequent updates from the Upstash team.
* **Rich toolset** – database access, web-search, text utilities, and more.
* **Open source** – released under the MIT licence.

## Installing Context7 in Saarthi

There are two common ways to register the server:

1. **Global configuration** – available in every workspace.
2. **Project-level configuration** – checked into version control alongside your code.

We'll cover both below.

### 1. Global configuration

1. Open the Saarthi **MCP settings** panel by clicking the <Codicon name="server" /> icon.
2. Click **Edit Global MCP**.
3. Paste the JSON below inside the `mcpServers` object and save.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows (cmd.exe) variant**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Also on **Windows (cmd)** you may need to invoke `npx` through `cmd.exe`:

### 2. Project-level configuration

If you prefer to commit the configuration to your repository, create a file called `.saarthi/mcp.json` at the project root and add the same snippet:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows (cmd.exe) variant**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

> When both global and project files define a server with the same name, **the project configuration wins**.

## Verifying the installation

1. Make sure **Enable MCP Servers** is turned on in the MCP settings panel.
2. You should now see **Context7** listed. Click the <Codicon name="activate" /> toggle to start it if it isn't already running.
3. Saarthi will prompt you the first time a Context7 tool is invoked. Approve the request to continue.
