# Import, Export, and Reset Settings

Saarthi allows you to manage your configuration settings effectively through export, import, and reset options. These features are useful for backing up your setup, sharing configurations with others, or restoring default settings if needed.

You can find these options at the bottom of the Saarthi settings page, accessible via the gear icon (<i class="codicon codicon-gear"></i>) in the Saarthi chat view.

## Export Settings

Clicking the **Export** button saves your current Saarthi settings to a JSON file.

*   **What's Exported:** The file includes your configured API Provider Profiles and Global Settings (UI preferences, mode configurations, context settings, etc.).
*   **Security Warning:** The exported JSON file contains **all** your configured API Provider Profiles and Global Settings. Crucially, this includes **API keys in plaintext**. Treat this file as highly sensitive. Do not share it publicly or with untrusted individuals, as it grants access to your API accounts.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Click **Export**.
    2.  A file save dialog appears, suggesting `saarthi-code-settings.json` as the filename (usually in your `~/Documents` folder).
    3.  Choose a location and save the file.

This creates a backup of your configuration or a file you can share.

## Import Settings

Clicking the **Import** button allows you to load settings from a previously exported JSON file.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Click **Import**.
    2.  A file open dialog appears. Select the `saarthi-code-settings.json` file (or similarly named file) you want to import.
    3.  Saarthi reads the file, validates its contents against the expected schema, and applies the settings.
*   **Merging:** Importing settings **merges** the configurations. It adds new API profiles and updates existing ones and global settings based on the file content. It does **not** delete configurations present in your current setup but missing from the imported file.
*   **Validation:** Only valid settings matching the internal schema can be imported, preventing configuration errors. A success notification appears upon completion.

## Reset Settings

Clicking the **Reset** button completely clears all Saarthi configuration data and returns the extension to its default state. This is a destructive action intended for troubleshooting or starting fresh.

*   **Warning:** This action is **irreversible**. It permanently deletes all API configurations (including keys stored in secret storage), custom modes, global settings, and task history.

*   **Process:**
    1.  Click the red **Reset** button.
    2.  A confirmation dialog appears, warning that the action cannot be undone.
    3.  Click "Yes" to confirm.

*   **What is Reset:**
    *   **API Provider Profiles:** All configurations are deleted from settings and secret storage.
    *   **Global Settings:** All preferences (UI, modes, approvals, browser, etc.) are reset to defaults.
    *   **Custom Modes:** All user-defined modes are deleted.
    *   **Secret Storage:** All API keys and other secrets managed by Saarthi are cleared.
    *   **Task History:** The current task stack is cleared.

*   **Result:** Saarthi returns to its initial state, as if freshly installed, with default settings and no user configurations.

Use this option only if you are certain you want to remove all Saarthi data or if instructed during troubleshooting. Consider exporting your settings first if you might want to restore them later.
