3. Paste your API key into the appropriate field
4. Select your model:
   - For **OpenRouter**: select `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet` ([model details](https://openrouter.ai/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet))

:::info Model Selection Advice
We strongly recommend **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** for the best experienceâ€”it generally "just works" out of the box. Saarthi has been extensively optimized for this model's capabilities and instruction-following behavior.

Selecting alternative models is an advanced feature that introduces complexity. Different models vary significantly in how they follow tool instructions, parse formats, and maintain context through multi-step operations. If you do experiment with other models, choose ones specifically designed for structured reasoning and tool use.
