# Tool Use Overview

Saarthi implements a sophisticated tool system that allows AI models to interact with your development environment in a controlled and secure manner. This document explains how tools work, when they're called, and how they're managed.

## Core Concepts

### Tool Groups

Tools are organized into logical groups based on their functionality:

| Category | Purpose | Tools | Common Use |
|----------|---------|-------|------------|
| **Read Group** | File system reading and exploration | [read_file](/advanced-usage/available-tools/read-file), [list_files](/advanced-usage/available-tools/list-files), [list_code_definition_names](/advanced-usage/available-tools/list-code-definition-names) | Code exploration and analysis |
| **Search Group** | Pattern and semantic searching | [search_files](/advanced-usage/available-tools/search-files), [codebase_search](/advanced-usage/available-tools/codebase-search) | Finding code patterns and functionality |
| **Edit Group** | File system modifications | [apply_diff](/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff), [insert_content](/advanced-usage/available-tools/insert-content), [search_and_replace](/advanced-usage/available-tools/search-and-replace), [write_to_file](/advanced-usage/available-tools/write-to-file) | Code changes and file manipulation |
| **Browser Group** | Web automation | [browser_action](/advanced-usage/available-tools/browser-action) | Web testing and interaction |
| **Command Group** | System command execution | [execute_command](/advanced-usage/available-tools/execute-command) | Running scripts, building projects |
| **MCP Group** | External tool integration | [use_mcp_tool](/advanced-usage/available-tools/use-mcp-tool), [access_mcp_resource](/advanced-usage/available-tools/access-mcp-resource) | Specialized functionality through external servers |
| **Workflow Group** | Mode and task management | [switch_mode](/advanced-usage/available-tools/switch-mode), [new_task](/advanced-usage/available-tools/new-task), [ask_followup_question](/advanced-usage/available-tools/ask-followup-question), [attempt_completion](/advanced-usage/available-tools/attempt-completion) | Context switching and task organization |

### Always Available Tools

Certain tools are accessible regardless of the current mode:

- [ask_followup_question](/advanced-usage/available-tools/ask-followup-question): Gather additional information from users
- [attempt_completion](/advanced-usage/available-tools/attempt-completion): Signal task completion
- [switch_mode](/advanced-usage/available-tools/switch-mode): Change operational modes
- [new_task](/advanced-usage/available-tools/new-task): Create subtasks

## Available Tools

### Read Tools
These tools help Roo understand your code and project:

- [new_task](/advanced-usage/available-tools/new-task) - Creates a new subtask

## Tool Calling Mechanism

### Handling Complex Tasks

For certain complex operations that require multiple steps, Roo doesn't just figure them out on the fly. Instead, it follows predefined, internal plans to ensure consistency and accuracy.

A prime example is creating a new MCP server, identified internally by `create_mcp_server`. **This identifier does not represent a tool you will see being called.** Rather, when you ask Roo to create a server, it triggers this known, multi-step workflow.

This specific workflow is initiated by Roo using its internal `fetch_instructions` tool (with the task `create_mcp_server`) to retrieve a detailed plan. This plan then guides Roo to make calls to several standard, documented tools in sequence, such as:

*   [`execute_command`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/execute-command) for running setup scripts (e.g., `npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server`).
*   [`write_to_file`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/write-to-file) or [`apply_diff`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff) for creating or modifying server code and configuration files.
*   [`ask_followup_question`](/advanced-usage/available-tools/ask-followup-question) to gather necessary information like API keys from you.
*   Other standard tools as needed for steps like determining file locations or updating configuration entries.

So, while the overall task (like `create_mcp_server`) is complex, it's ultimately accomplished by intelligently orchestrating the standard tools available in your environment. This approach allows Roo to reliably perform complex operations by leveraging the tools documented here.

### When Tools Are Called

Tools are invoked under specific conditions:

1. **Direct Task Requirements**
   - When specific actions are needed to complete a task as decided by the LLM
   - In response to user requests
   - During automated workflows

2. **Mode-Based Availability**
   - Different modes enable different tool sets
   - Mode switches can trigger tool availability changes
   - Some tools are restricted to specific modes

3. **Context-Dependent Calls**
   - Based on the current state of the workspace
   - In response to system events
   - During error handling and recovery

### Decision Process

The system uses a multi-step process to determine tool availability:

1. **Mode Validation**
   ```typescript
   isToolAllowedForMode(
       tool: string,
       modeSlug: string,
       customModes: ModeConfig[],
       toolRequirements?: Record<string, boolean>,
       toolParams?: Record<string, any>
   )
   ```

2. **Requirement Checking**
   - System capability verification
   - Resource availability
   - Permission validation

3. **Parameter Validation**
   - Required parameter presence
   - Parameter type checking
   - Value validation

## Technical Implementation

### Tool Call Processing

1. **Initialization**
   - Tool name and parameters are validated
   - Mode compatibility is checked
   - Requirements are verified

2. **Execution**
   ```typescript
   const toolCall = {
       type: "tool_call",
       name: chunk.name,
       arguments: chunk.input,
       callId: chunk.callId
   }
   ```

3. **Result Handling**
   - Success/failure determination
   - Result formatting
   - Error handling

### Security and Permissions

1. **Access Control**
   - File system restrictions
   - Command execution limitations
   - Network access controls

2. **Validation Layers**
   - Tool-specific validation
   - Mode-based restrictions
   - System-level checks

## Mode Integration

### Mode-Based Tool Access

Tools are made available based on the current mode:

- **Code Mode**: Full access to file system tools, code editing capabilities, command execution
- **Ask Mode**: Limited to reading tools, information gathering capabilities, no file system modifications
- **Architect Mode**: Design-focused tools, documentation capabilities, limited execution rights
- **Custom Modes**: Can be configured with specific tool access for specialized workflows

### Mode Switching

1. **Process**
   - Current mode state preservation
   - Tool availability updates
   - Context switching

2. **Impact on Tools**
   - Tool set changes
   - Permission adjustments
   - Context preservation

## Best Practices

### Tool Usage Guidelines

1. **Efficiency**
   - Use the most specific tool for the task
   - Avoid redundant tool calls
   - Batch operations when possible

2. **Security**
   - Validate inputs before tool calls
   - Use minimum required permissions
   - Follow security best practices

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error checking
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Handle failures gracefully

### Common Patterns

1. **Information Gathering**
   ```
   [ask_followup_question](/advanced-usage/available-tools/ask-followup-question) → [read_file](/advanced-usage/available-tools/read-file) → [codebase_search](/advanced-usage/available-tools/codebase-search)
   ```

2. **Code Modification**
   ```
   [read_file](/advanced-usage/available-tools/read-file) → [apply_diff](/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff) → [attempt_completion](/advanced-usage/available-tools/attempt-completion)
   ```

3. **Task Management**
   ```
   [new_task](/advanced-usage/available-tools/new-task) → [switch_mode](/advanced-usage/available-tools/switch-mode) → [execute_command](/advanced-usage/available-tools/execute-command)
   ```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Error Types

1. **Tool-Specific Errors**
   - Parameter validation failures
   - Execution errors
   - Resource access issues

2. **System Errors**
   - Permission denied
   - Resource unavailable
   - Network failures

3. **Context Errors**
   - Invalid mode for tool
   - Missing requirements
   - State inconsistencies

### Recovery Strategies

1. **Automatic Recovery**
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Fallback options
   - State restoration

2. **User Intervention**
   - Error notifications
   - Recovery suggestions
   - Manual intervention options
