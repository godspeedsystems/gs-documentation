# Local Development Setup

:::note Developer Information Only
This section is for developers contributing to Saarthi or those who wish to build and run the extension from source.
:::

To set up Saarthi for local development:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/godspeedsystems/Saarthi.git
    cd Saarthi
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Saarthi uses `pnpm` for package management.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the extension for development:**
    You have two primary methods:

    *   **Directly in VS Code (Recommended for active development):**
        *   Open the cloned `Saarthi` folder in VS Code.
        *   Press `F5` (or select **Run** â†’ **Start Debugging** from the menu). This opens a new VS Code window (Extension Development Host) with Saarthi running.
        *   Changes to the webview code (under `webview-ui/`) will often update live.
        *   Changes to the core extension code (under `src/`) typically require restarting the Extension Development Host window.

    *   **Building and Installing a VSIX package:**
        This method is useful for testing the packaged extension or distributing development builds.
        1.  Build the VSIX file:
            ```bash
            pnpm build
            ```
            A `.vsix` file (e.g., `saarthi-<version>.vsix`) will be created in the `bin/` directory.

        2.  Install the VSIX in VS Code:
            *   **Using the command line:**
                ```bash
                code --install-extension bin/saarthi-<version>.vsix
                ```
                (Replace `<version>` with the actual version number in the filename).
            *   **Using the VS Code interface:**
                *   Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
                *   Click the "..." (More Actions) menu in the Extensions view sidebar.
                *   Select "Install from VSIX..."
                *   Browse to and select the generated `.vsix` file from the `bin/` directory.
