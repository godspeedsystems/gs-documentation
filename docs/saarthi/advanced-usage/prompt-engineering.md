# Prompt Engineering Tips

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective instructions for AI models like Saarthi.  Well-written prompts lead to better results, fewer errors, and a more efficient workflow.

## General Principles

*   **Be Clear and Specific:** Clearly state what you want Saarthi to do. Avoid ambiguity.
    *   **Bad:** Fix the code.
    *   **Good:** Fix the bug in the `calculateTotal` function that causes it to return incorrect results.

*   **Provide Context:** Use [Context Mentions](/basic-usage/context-mentions) to refer to specific files, folders, or problems.
    *   **Good:** `@/src/utils.ts` Refactor the `calculateTotal` function to use async/await.

*   **Break Down Tasks:** Divide complex tasks into smaller, well-defined steps.

*   **Give Examples:** If you have a specific coding style or pattern in mind, provide examples.

*   **Specify Output Format:** If you need the output in a particular format (e.g., JSON, Markdown), specify it in the prompt.

*   **Iterate:** Don't be afraid to refine your prompt if the initial results aren't what you expect.

## Thinking vs. Doing

It's often helpful to guide Saarthi through a "think-then-do" process:

1.  **Analyze:** Ask Saarthi to analyze the current code, identify problems, or plan the approach.
2.  **Plan:**  Have Saarthi outline the steps it will take to complete the task.
3.  **Execute:**  Instruct Saarthi to implement the plan, one step at a time.
4.  **Review:**  Carefully review the results of each step before proceeding.

## Using Custom Instructions

You can provide custom instructions to further tailor Saarthi's behavior. There are two types of custom instructions:

*   **Global Custom Instructions:** Apply to all modes.
*   **Mode-Specific Custom Instructions:** Apply only to a specific mode (e.g., Code, Architect, Ask, Debug, or a custom mode).

Custom instructions are added to the system prompt, providing persistent guidance to the AI model. You can use these to:

*   Enforce coding style guidelines.
*   Specify preferred libraries or frameworks.
*   Define project-specific conventions.
*   Adjust Saarthi's tone or personality.

See the [Custom Instructions](/features/custom-instructions) section for more details.

## Handling Ambiguity

If your request is ambiguous or lacks sufficient detail, Saarthi might:

*   **Make Assumptions:**  It might proceed based on its best guess, which may not be what you intended.
*   **Ask Follow-Up Questions:** It might use the `ask_followup_question` tool to clarify your request.

It's generally better to provide clear and specific instructions from the start to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

## Providing Feedback

If Saarthi doesn't produce the desired results, you can provide feedback by:

*   **Rejecting Actions:** Click the "Reject" button when Saarthi proposes an action you don't want.
*   **Providing Explanations:** When rejecting, explain *why* you're rejecting the action.  This helps Saarthi learn from its mistakes.
*   **Rewording Your Request:** Try rephrasing your initial task or providing more specific instructions.
*   **Manually Correcting:** If there are a few small issues, you can also directly modify the code before accepting the changes.

## Examples

**Good Prompt:**

> `@/src/components/Button.tsx` Refactor the `Button` component to use the `useState` hook instead of the `useReducer` hook.

**Bad Prompt:**

> Fix the button.

**Good Prompt:**

> Create a new file named `utils.py` and add a function called `calculate_average` that takes a list of numbers and returns their average.

**Bad Prompt:**

> Write some Python code.

**Good Prompt:**

> `@problems` Address all errors and warnings in the current file.

**Bad Prompt:**

> Fix everything.

By following these tips, you can write effective prompts that get the most out of Saarthi's capabilities.
