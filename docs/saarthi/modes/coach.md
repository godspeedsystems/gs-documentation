# Coach Mode
Your personal AI learning mentor within Saarthi. Coach dynamically builds customized learning roadmaps, assigns hands-on exercises, and evaluates your coding and conceptual progress ‚Äî with special focus on Godspeed and general tech topics.

## Mode Name
Coach

## Mode Identifier
/coach

## Description
Coach is a deeply personalized AI agent designed to act as a learning guide for developers. It builds custom Markdown roadmaps, offers tailored exercises, evaluates code correctness and optimality, and dynamically adapts based on user feedback and progress. It is especially optimized for learning Godspeed, including Node.js, TypeScript, and backend workflows.

## Primary Use Cases
- Personalized skill-building roadmaps (e.g., "Learn TypeScript", "Learn Godspeed")
- Markdown-based roadmap creation for self-paced learning
- Assignment of interactive coding exercises (including half-written code)
- Evaluation of user code: correctness, completeness, and optimality
- Adaptive learning: roadmap adjusts to user skill level and feedback

## Internal Capabilities / Agents

- Roadmap Generator: Builds .md files for requested learning topics
- Exercise Creator: Produces structured exercises based on topic and difficulty
- Evaluator: Automatically evaluates user submissions using test cases
- Saarthi QA Mode Integration: Uses existing QA Modes to test and score Godspeed-specific code

## Model Behavior & Tool Access
Capability	    |   Status
Read files	    |   ‚úÖ
Write files	    |   ‚úÖ (.md, optionally test files)
Execute commands|   ‚úÖ (within secure scope)
Evaluate code	|   ‚úÖ
Use external documentation	|‚úÖ (via RAG MCP)
Manage learning flow	|‚úÖ

## Preferred Models:

GPT-4.5 / Claude 3 Sonnet (Roadmap & Feedback)
Claude 3 Opus / Gemini 1.5 Pro (Exercise generation & evaluation)

## File Permissions
Path	    Access
docs/	    ‚úÖ Can create and overwrite Markdown learning files
tests/	    ‚úÖ Can create exercises and evaluation files
src/	    ‚ùå Cannot edit application code
System	    ‚úÖ Can use secure shell commands if needed for test execution

## Scope
‚úÖ In Scope
- General development topics (e.g., JS, TS, Go, Python, Git)
- Godspeed framework: events, workflows, datasources, testing
- Custom user-requested topics
- Algorithmic and software design tasks

‚ùå Out of Scope
- Full-stack frontend/backend integration testing
- Persistent session storage (unless backend provided)
- Certification or human coaching simulation
- Live deployment or CI/CD execution

## Embedded Behaviors
- Starts every session with goal + skill level assessment
- Generates Markdown roadmaps stored under /docs/
- Offers tailored exercises:
    - Prebuilt
    - Half-written code
    - User-specified topic
    - Evaluates submitted code:

‚úÖ Simple: runs auto test cases, gives feedback
‚úÖ Complex: scores for correctness + optimality
‚úÖ Godspeed: invokes qa mode testing framework

Adjusts roadmap based on feedback and test outcomes

üîÑ Workflow Integration
Stores user roadmaps in:

```
docs/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ topic_level_roadmap.md
```
Exercises + evaluations go to:

```
tests/coach/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ topic_exercise_1.test.ts
```
Leverages:

qa modes for test execution

rag-node MCP for Godspeed doc retrieval

command group to create files and evaluate code

## Safety Features
All commands run in restricted, sandboxed shell

No production files are modified

AI seeks explicit confirmation before overwriting files

User code execution is isolated and guarded

## Shortcut to Activate
```
Mac: ‚åò + .  
Windows/Linux: Ctrl + .
```

### Related Modes
/qa: For test generation and validation

/ask: To understand foundational concepts

/pm-lead: For planning your product + technical roadmap

/orchestrator: To connect your learning into production flows

## Example Prompts
```
"I want to learn Godspeed workflows ‚Äî beginner level"
"Help me master TypeScript for backend"
"Give me an exercise on recursion in Python"
"Evaluate this custom hash table I wrote in C++"
"Create a roadmap to learn Kafka with Godspeed"
```
## Advanced Configuration (Optional YAML)
```
coachConfig:
  roadmap_path: docs/
  exercise_path: tests/coach/
  rag_enabled: true
  evaluation_mode: full
  test_case_difficulty: [basic, intermediate, advanced]
```

## Sample Outputs
docs/web_development_beginner_roadmap.md
docs/godspeed_events_advanced_roadmap.md
tests/coach/js_array_map_exercise.test.ts
tests/coach/godspeed_event_test_suite.test.yaml

## Future Improvements
Persistent learning dashboard with resume support
Live code editor integration with auto-feedback
Visual roadmap generation
Progress tracking and gamification
Peer sharing of roadmaps/exercises
Voice interaction and multimodal coaching

## Author Notes
This mode is designed to transform Saarthi into a personal learning companion ‚Äî one that doesn‚Äôt just teach, but guides, adapts, and evaluates. It bridges learning and doing, especially for complex systems like Godspeed, and enables fast, effective skill building with structure and feedback.
