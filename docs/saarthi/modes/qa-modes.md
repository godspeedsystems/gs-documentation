# üîç QA Lead Engineer
Your AI-powered Quality Assurance (QA) assistant within Saarthi.

## Overview
The QA Lead Engineer acts as your single point of contact for all QA-related tasks. It internally coordinates with other specialized QA agents (QA Document Writer and QA Coder) to complete your requests, streamlining the testing process and automating various QA activities. 

> As a user, you will only interact with the **QA Lead Engineer** mode.

## Primary Use Cases
- Setting up the testing environment for new or existing projects.
- Writing various types of test files (unit, functional, integration).
- Generating detailed test coverage and status reports.
- Batch-generating multiple test files for entire projects or specific modules.

## Example Prompts
```
"Set up the testing environment for my project."
"Write a functional test for the `/api/users` endpoint."
"Generate an integration test report."
"Create tests for all functional routes in my codebase."
"I need a unit test for the `calculatePrice` function."
```

## Internal Capabilities / Agents

- **Test Environment Setup:** Detects framework, creates necessary test files and configurations, and integrates with Swagger specs.
- **Test File Generator:** Orchestrates the creation of unit, functional, and integration test files.
- **Test Report Generator:** Runs test suites with coverage and compiles comprehensive markdown reports.
- **Batch Test Creator:** Automates the generation of multiple test files based on project context.
- **QA Document Writer Integration:** Delegates the creation of test strategy documents.
- **QA Coder Integration:** Delegates the writing of actual test files.

- Generation of unit, functional, and integration tests.
- Comprehensive test reporting (coverage, status).
- Bulk test file generation for large codebases.
- Integration with PRD/TRD for test stub creation.
- Guidance on best practices for testing.

‚ùå Out of Scope
- Manual testing execution or human QA simulation.
- Direct modification of production code (only test files are generated/modified).
- Persistent session storage for test results (reports are generated as files).
- Live deployment or CI/CD pipeline management.
- Deep-dive debugging of application logic (refer to Debug mode).

## Embedded Behaviors
- Initiates conversations by offering clear task options (Setup, Write Single, Generate Report, Write Multiple).
- Guides users through necessary inputs (e.g., `.env` updates, PRD provision).
- Automatically detects project framework for tailored test setup.
- Updates `qa-context.json` to track testing progress.
- Provides clear completion messages for each task.

üîÑ Workflow Integration
Stores test reports in:

```
docs/test/<type>/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM.md
```
Manages test progress and metadata in:

```
qa-context.json
```

### Leverages:

- `qa-document-writer` for test strategy documents.
- `qa-coder` for actual test file generation.
- `rag-node` MCP for testing best practices and framework-specific guidance.
- `command` group to execute test suites and manage files.

## Safety Features
- All commands run in a restricted, sandboxed shell.
- Emphasizes mandatory `.env` file updates to prevent production data impact.
- AI seeks explicit confirmation before making significant changes.
- User code execution for testing is isolated and guarded.

# üìÑ QA Document Writer
The QA Document Writer AI agent is responsible for generating comprehensive and actionable test strategy documents for specific functions, as assigned by the QA Lead Engineer.

## Overview
This mode focuses on creating detailed test strategy documents, including unit and functional test strategies. It follows strict templates and logic to ensure standardized and high-quality documentation, which then serves as a blueprint for the QA Coder.

## Primary Use Cases
- Generating unit test strategy documents.
- Generating functional test strategy documents.
- Documenting test cases and expected outcomes.

## Example Prompts
(This mode is typically invoked internally by QA Lead Engineer, not directly by user)

## Internal Capabilities / Agents
- **Strategy Template Engine:** Applies predefined templates for different test types.
- **Test Case Generator:** Creates detailed test cases based on function/feature descriptions.
