# üíª Code Mode
A highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks and best practices.

## Overview
Code mode is the primary interface for hands-on development, offering comprehensive and context-aware support for general coding tasks. It combines deep technical expertise with practical tool access to accelerate development workflows, ensuring adherence to best practices and framework guidelines.

## Primary Use Cases
- General purpose coding in any tech stack or language. 
- Writing new code and implementing features.
- Create Full Stack Project
- Create microservices using 4th-gen godspeed framework.


## Example Prompts
```
"Implement a new user authentication flow using JWT."
"Create a CRUD API for the 'Product' entity."
"Refactor this TypeScript module for better performance."
"Troubleshoot why my API endpoint is returning a 500 error."
"How do I configure a new HTTP event?"
"Generate types for my frontend from the swagger spec."
```
## Framework-Based Guardrails

Code Mode has additional capability to develop backends using **4th Gen Godspeed Framework**, enforcing in-built guardrails and best practices in your project:

- ‚úÖ **[Single Source of Truth](https://godspeed.systems/blog/schema-driven-development-and-single-source-of-truth)**
- ‚úÖ **[Schema-Driven Development](https://godspeed.systems/blog/schema-driven-development-and-single-source-of-truth)**
- ‚úÖ **[Configure Over Code](https://godspeed.systems/blog/configure-over-code-and-declarative-programming)**
- ‚úÖ **[Modular & Decoupled Architecture](https://godspeed.systems/blog/software-development-with-godspeeds-guard-rails#heading-guard-rail-4-decoupled-architecture)**
- ‚úÖ **[Built-in Validation & Security](https://godspeed.systems/blog/software-development-with-godspeeds-guard-rails#heading-guard-rail-3-security)**

## Internal Capabilities

- **Code Generator:** Generates code snippets, functions, and full implementations based on requirements.
- **Refactoring Engine:** Analyzes code for improvements, applies refactoring patterns, and ensures best practices.
- **Documentation Integrator:** Fetches and applies context from godspeed documentation and verified sources.


## Model Behavior & Tool Access

No tool restrictions‚Äîfull flexibility for all coding tasks

| Capability | Status |
|---|---|
| Read files | ‚úÖ |
| Write files | ‚úÖ |
| Execute commands | ‚úÖ |
| Evaluate code | ‚úÖ |
| Use external documentation | ‚úÖ |
| Manage learning flow | ‚ùå |

## Preferred Models:

- Gemini 1.5 Pro / GPT-4o (Complex code generation, architecture, and deep problem-solving)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash / Claude 3 Haiku (Routine coding tasks, quick edits, and general development support)


## Scope
‚úÖ In Scope
- Implementing new features and functionalities across various tech stacks.
- Refactoring and optimizing existing code for performance and maintainability.
- Debugging and fixing bugs, including systematic troubleshooting.
- Full project lifecycle support: setup, configuration, API/event development, plugin management, database integration, authentication, and authorization.
- Generating frontend artifacts (stores, types, clients) from backend API specifications.
- Providing guidance on best practices, design patterns, and architectural decisions.

‚ùå Out of Scope
- High-level architectural planning and strategic design (use Architect mode).
- Deep theoretical explanations or academic learning roadmaps (use Ask or Coach mode).
- Formal code reviews and policy enforcement (use Code Review mode).
- Live deployment or advanced CI/CD pipeline management (use DevOps mode).
