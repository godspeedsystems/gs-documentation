# üíªCode Mode

**Code Mode** is the primary interface for hands-on development across **all tech stacks and languages**. It provides context-aware coding assistance, generates new features, refactors existing code, and troubleshoots issues ‚Äî ensuring adherence to best practices and modern standards.

### Primary Use Cases

* General-purpose coding in any language or framework
* Writing new code and implementing features
* Refactoring and optimizing existing code
* Debugging and troubleshooting errors
* Generating frontend artifacts (types, stores, clients) from APIs

### Example Prompts

* "Implement a new user authentication flow using JWT."
* "Refactor this TypeScript module for better performance."
* "Troubleshoot why my API endpoint is returning a 500 error."

### Scope

‚úÖ **In Scope**

* Implementing features across any tech stack
* Refactoring & optimization
* Debugging & bug fixes
* API/event development and database integration
* Applying best practices and design patterns

‚ùå **Out of Scope**

* High-level architectural design (use Architect Mode)
* Formal reviews (use Code Review Mode)
* Deployment tasks (use DevOps Mode)
* Academic roadmaps (use Ask/Coach Mode)

## Internal Capabilities

- **Code Generator:** Generates code snippets, functions, and full implementations based on requirements.
- **Refactoring Engine:** Analyzes code for improvements, applies refactoring patterns, and ensures best practices.

## Preferred Models:

- Gemini 1.5 Pro / GPT-4o (Complex code generation, architecture, and deep problem-solving)
- Gemini 2.5 Flash / Claude 3 Haiku (Routine coding tasks, quick edits, and general development support)
