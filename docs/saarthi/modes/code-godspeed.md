# ⚡Code-Godspeed Mode

    **Code-Godspeed Mode** is a specialized coding agent for backend and microservices development using the **Param 4th-gen framework**. It ensures that all generated code strictly follows **framework-aligned guardrails** — enabling clean, scalable, and maintainable backend projects.

    ### Primary Use Cases

    * Creating microservices with the Godspeed framework
    * Building backend APIs with schema-driven workflows
    * Configuring events, datasources, and plugins via guardrails
    * Automating boilerplate setup for Godspeed projects

    ### Example Prompts

    * "Create a CRUD API for the `Product` entity in Godspeed."
    * "How do I configure a new HTTP event in Godspeed?"
    * "Generate types for my frontend from the Swagger spec."

    ### Scope

    ✅ **In Scope**

    * Backend microservices and APIs with Godspeed
    * Godspeed-specific config: events, datasources, plugins
    * Applying Godspeed framework guardrails automatically

    ❌ **Out of Scope**

    * General-purpose coding in non-Godspeed stacks (use Code Mode)
    * High-level planning (use Architect Mode)
    * Deployment (use DevOps Mode)


    ## Framework-Based Guardrails

    Code-Godspeed Mode has capability to develop backends using **4th Gen Param Framework**, enforcing in-built guardrails and best practices in your project:
