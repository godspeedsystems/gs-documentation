# Saarthi Release Notes (2.0.12)

## New Features Added

## [Workflows](/docs/saarthi/workflows)

We’re excited to introduce Workflows in Saarthi – a powerful automation layer that lets you execute complex development tasks with just one selection.  
Instead of typing commands or manually configuring tools, you can now simply: 
- Open Saarthi 
- Select a workflow from the paWorkflows dropdown (over 20 available!) 
- Hit Enter 
✅ Saarthi takes care of the rest — fast, consistent, and error-free. 

### ✨ Key Highlights 

Automation First – From scaffolding a new Godspeed project to generating UI components or automating your release process- workflows handle everything. 

20+ Predefined Workflows – Saarthi comes packed with ready-to-use workflows covering the entire development lifecycle. Some examples include: 

- Setup Project on Docker 
- Implement Authentication in Godspeed 
- Prompt-to-UI Generation 
- GitHub Issue to PR with Review 

Whether you’re starting a project, learning something, creating documentation, raising a PR or deploying  — Saarthi has a workflow for it. 

## [UI Generation](/docs/saarthi/workflows#7-figma-to-ui-generation)

This feature lets you scaffold and generate complete UI journeys directly from your inputs, whether from Figma designs, PRDs/TRDs, or prompt-driven generation. Saarthi automates strategy creation, component scaffolding, API integration, and responsive UI development — all inside your workspace. 

### Highlights: 

- One-click Workflow – Select the UI-Generation workflow in Saarthi and answer guided prompts. 
- Figma → UI – Import components from Figma with automatic hierarchy extraction. 
- PRD/TRD Aware – Generate UI based on product/technical requirement docs. 
- Smart Scaffolding – Auto-create components, integrate APIs via OpenAPI specs, and generate Redux slices. 
- Strategy + Execution – Each page/component becomes a milestone, orchestrated step-by-step with approvals. 
- Audit & Control – Saarthi maintains execution history, approvals, and regeneration logs. 

## [Godspeed Specialized Agent:](/docs/saarthi/modes/code-godspeed)

Saarthi now includes a dedicated trusted agent for 4th generation Param framework microservices. This ensures your services are created, configured, and managed in a secure, compliant, and reliable environment — with guardrails applied automatically. It is by default connected to Godspeed MCP Server, to build framework aligned microservices.
