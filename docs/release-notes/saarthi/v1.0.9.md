 
# Saarthi 1.0.9 Release Notes:

This release of Saarthi introduces transformative capabilities by combining context-aware intelligence, integrated tooling, and multi-mode workflows to redefine developer efficiency. 

## Context-Aware Intelligence via RAG Integration 

Saarthi now leverages a RAG-node agent integrated seamlessly with Godspeed Mode, enabling advanced documentation-aware responses. 

### Key Enhancements: 

RAG Integration: A new mcp.get-context tool fetches relevant information from vector databases, allowing precise answers contextualized to the user's codebase and documentation. 

Intelligent Routing: Queries in Godspeed Mode auto-trigger this tool, enriching the LLM’s response with accurate context and sources. 

## New Mode: Code Review 

Introducing the Code Review Mode — a context-rich, multi-dimensional static analysis system for software projects. It performs a multi-dimensional review that includes Compliance, Code Quality, Readability, Linting, Correctness, and Completeness. This mode operates with a comprehensive set of permissions including read, edit, command, and mcp. 

### Configuration and Customization: 

To leverage the mode's full potential, an initial setup is recommended: 

**Establish Context Documents:** Create a PRD (Product Requirements Document) and TLD (Technical Design Document) within a docs/ directory at the project root. These documents provide the necessary context for in-depth analysis. 

**Configure an Ignore File:** Add an ignore file (e.g., .saarthi-ignore) to the project's root. This file should list any assets (e.g., node_modules/, *.log) to be excluded from the review. 

**Initiate the Review:** Start the review process by navigating to this mode in Saarthi and using a simple prompt, such as: "Review this project." 

For projects using the Godspeed framework, the mode automatically uses the `RAG-node MCP` (make sure you have provided Gemini API key in mcp settings file) to retrieve official documentation and best practices, ensuring the review is highly aligned with the framework's design principles. 

Output: 

Inline comments added directly to source files. 
Full structured reports stored as `review-<date>.md` 

## New Mode: DevOps 

Saarthi now includes DevOps Mode to streamline deployment tasks for all types of projects. 

### Key Features: 

**Local Docker Deployment:** Automatically generates Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and .dockerignore. It builds and runs the project locally in Docker with minimal prompts. 

**Render Deployment:** Uses a new Render MCP tool (added to global MCPs). Just provide your Git repo URL and Render account details, and Saarthi handles the full Render deployment pipeline. 

### How to Use: 

- Create a Godspeed project. 
- Go to the Saarthi extension and switch to DevOps Mode. 
- Say: “Deploy locally” or “Deploy on Render.” 
- Saarthi will take care of the rest—automating both infrastructure setup and deployment. 

## General Improvements 

* MCP Tooling Enhancements: Tools like tool.get_context and mcp.get-context are now auto-whitelisted for fast context fetching.
