This release focuses on developer-first enhancements, improving event validation fidelity to help you move faster and build stronger.

## Key Improvements:

### Event Path Parameter Validation Fix
In previous versions, events were not validating their path parameters and response schemas correctly. This was due to how the framework was registering and mapping schemas.

ðŸ›  Fix: The framework now correctly registers validation schemas for events with path parameters, ensuring request/response validation works seamlessly.
