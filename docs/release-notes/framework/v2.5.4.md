## Framework v2.5.4 Patch Release – Event Validation Logging Enhancement

This patch builds upon the improvements introduced by enhancing the developer debugging experience for invalid events.

### 📝 Change: Improved Logging for Event Validation Errors

### Before: 
validateEvent.errors was logged as a raw object, often resulting in unreadable or incomplete error traces in some environments.

### After:
Validation errors are now logged as a stringified JSON, making them clearer and easier to parse in logs and debugging tools.

```
logger.error(JSON.stringify(validateEvent.errors));
```

✅ Benefit: This small but impactful patch ensures that validation failures are human-readable and structured, helping developers quickly identify and fix schema mismatches in event configurations.
