## Framework 2.5.6 Release 

ðŸ†• Feature: Automatic Serialization of Non-Serializable Data Types

### Problem
Previously, if a Godspeed event handler or datasource returned a response containing non-JSON-serializable data types like BigInt, Date, Function, or Error, it could cause:

- TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt
- CORS errors and broken responses

### Solution
Godspeed now includes built-in response sanitization and serialization logic at the framework level. All event handler responses (GSStatus) are automatically sanitized before being sent, ensuring they are JSON-safe and reliable across all transport layers.

### Key Improvements

- Deep sanitization of response data
- Automatic conversion of:
    BigInt â†’ string
    Date â†’ ISO string
    Symbol â†’ .toString()

- Covers all datasources (Prisma, Redis, custom integrations)
- Prevents serialization crashes in res.json() / res.send()
- Sanity check is performed on both original and sanitized response before sending
- Added try-catch block around JSON.stringify() test before returning response
- Implemented graceful error handling for serialization failures
- Added detailed error logging with response data context


### Developer Impact

- No need to manually convert BigInt, Date, or Error in handlers or plugins
- Responses are now safer and more stable across environments
- Plugin authors can return raw native JS values â€” framework handles serialization

#### Example

```
return new GSStatus(true, 200, 'OK', { id: 123n, created: new Date() });
```
Transforms to:

```
{
  "id": "123",
  "created": "2025-07-01T08:00:00.000Z"
}
```
