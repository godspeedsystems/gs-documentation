## Framework 2.5.5 Patch Release â€“ Enhanced Logging for Module Import Errors
This release focuses on dramatically improving developer experience when debugging module import failures during function or handler loading.

### Problem
Previously, when modules failed to load (e.g., due to missing packages or syntax issues), developers received generic or empty error messages like {}. This made it difficult to: Identify which module failed and understand the error cause.

### Solution: Advanced Contextual Logging for Import Errors
The module loader now logs comprehensive error context, turning previously opaque errors into actionable insights.

### Key Improvements:
* File Context: Shows both relative and absolute file paths of the failed module.
* Require Chain Mapping: Logs the full require() stack leading up to the failure.
* Missing Dependency Detection: Identifies uninstalled packages and suggests the install command.
* Timestamp Logging: Adds UTC timestamps to track when the failure occurred.
* Fallback Handling: Ensures graceful degradation if full context extraction fails.
