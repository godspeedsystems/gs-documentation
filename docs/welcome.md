## Build Modern Microservices in 3 simple steps

With **Saarthi**, your multi agent dev team in vs code, building enterprise-grade systems is now just **one prompt away**.

## Step 1: [Install Godspeed JS](/docs/microservices-framework/guide/get-started.md)

## Step 2: [Install Saarthi in VS Code](/docs/saarthi/getting-started/installing.mdx)

## Step 3: Open Saarthi & Select [Code Mode](/docs/saarthi/modes/code.md)

1. From VS Code sidebar, Open **Saarthi**
2. Choose `ðŸ’» Code` from the mode selector
> Saarthi is by default connected to **Godspeed MCP Server**, to build framework aligned microservices.

## Step 4: Enter Prompt
In the Saarthi chat box, type what you want to build. For Example:
```
Create a godspeed microservice for product catalog with CRUD operations using Postgres database.
```

Saarthi will:

* Scaffold your project structure
* Add the right datasource and handler configs
* Generate event handlers, validations, and workflows
* Auto-document your API routes

All with framework-aligned best practices and zero boilerplate.
