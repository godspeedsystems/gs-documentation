# Welcome to Godspeed

> **From Idea to Scale — 10x Faster & Better**

**Godspeed** is the first **agentic SDLC platform** that brings order, speed, and consistency to the software development lifecycle. Whether you're an individual developer or a scaling team, Godspeed gives you the tools to ship clean, compliant code faster — with fewer bugs and less chaos.


## What is Godspeed?

Godspeed combines three powerful innovations into one cohesive developer experience:

- **[Saarthi: Agentic SDLC Team](/docs/saarthi/index.md)**  
  AI teammates for product planning, development, testing, DevOps, and monitoring.
  
- **[4th-Generation Framework Stack](/docs/microservices-framework/guide/get-started.md)**  
  Build full-stack, event-driven, distributed systems with fewer lines of code and [built-in best practices](/docs/microservices-framework/introduction/guard-rails.md)

- **[Godspeed Studio](https://studio.godspeed.systems)** — a powerful visual editor for managing and building your Godspeed projects through an intuitive UI.

> Even entry-level engineers — or LLMs — can ship production-grade software using Godspeed.
