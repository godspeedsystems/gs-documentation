## Build Modern Microservices in 3 simple steps

With **Saarthi**, your multi agent dev team in vs code, building enterprise-grade systems is now just **one prompt away**.

### Step 1: [Install Framework](/docs/microservices-framework/guide/get-started.md)

### Step 2: [Install Saarthi in VS Code](/docs/saarthi/getting-started/installing.mdx)

### Step 3: Select [Code-Godspeed Mode](/docs/saarthi/modes/code-godspeed.md) and Enter Prompt

    - Choose `Code-Godspeed` from the mode selector. It is by default connected to **Godspeed MCP Server**, to build   framework aligned microservices.
