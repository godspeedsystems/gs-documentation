# Welcome to Godspeed

> **From Idea to Scale — 10x Faster & Better**

**Godspeed** is the first **agentic SDLC platform** that brings order, speed, and consistency to the software development lifecycle. Whether you're an individual developer or a scaling team, Godspeed gives you the tools to ship clean, compliant code faster — with fewer bugs and less chaos.


## What is Godspeed?

Godspeed combines two powerful innovations into one cohesive developer experience:

- **[Saarthi: Agentic SDLC Team](/docs/saarthi/index.md)**  
  AI teammates for product planning, development, testing, DevOps, and monitoring.
  
- **[4th-Generation Framework Stack](/docs/microservices-framework/guide/get-started.md)**  
  Build full-stack, event-driven, distributed systems with fewer lines of code and [built-in best practices](/docs/microservices-framework/introduction/guard-rails.md)

> Even entry-level engineers — or LLMs — can ship production-grade software using Godspeed.

## Build Your First Microservice with AI-Powered Speed

Godspeed is a 4th-gen microservices framework that brings the power of AI directly into your development workflow — with **zero boilerplate**, **multi-agent assistance**, and **context-aware code generation**.

With **Saarthi**, your in-editor AI assistant, building enterprise-grade systems is now just **one prompt away**.

---

## Prerequisite: 

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be installed on your system before installing Saarthi.

## Step 1: [Install Saarthi From VS Code Marketplace](/docs/saarthi/getting-started/installing.mdx)

## Step 2: Open Saarthi & Select [Code-Godspeed Mode](/docs/saarthi/modes/godspeed.md)

1. From VS Code sidebar, Open **Saarthi**
3. Choose `⚡ Code-Godspeed` from the mode selector

> Saarthi will now automatically connect to **Chaitanya**, the built-in RAG agent, for context-aware coding powered by Godspeed’s framework intelligence.

---

## Step 3: Create Your First Microservice — Just One Prompt

In the Saarthi chat box, type:

```
Create a microservice for product catalog with CRUD operations and Postgres as datasource.
```

Saarthi will:

* Scaffold your project structure
* Add the right datasource and handler configs
* Generate event handlers, validations, and workflows
* Auto-document your API routes

All with framework-aligned best practices and zero boilerplate.

---

##  Step 4: Run Your Service Locally

```bash
cd <project-name>
godspeed serve
```

Test your endpoints instantly in Swagger UI.
