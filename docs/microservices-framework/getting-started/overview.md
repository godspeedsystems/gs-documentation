# Starting with Godspeed's meta-framework for Nodejs.

In this section, you will learn how to install the meta-framework using the command line interface (CLI) and how to either create a new project with the framework or (in case of an existing Nodejs project) integrate Godspeed into it.


### Pre-requisites:

1. Node 18 and npm
2. Git
3. VS Code or any code editor

### Quick start

```bash
  npm install -g @godspeedsystems/godspeed
  godspeed create my_new_project
  cd my_new_project
  godspeed serve
  # open localhost:3000/api-docs ( as per default port and 
  # swagger endpoint as setup in eventsources/http.yaml)
```


The default port number is `3000`, API base url is `/`, and swagger docs url is `/api-docs`. If you want to customise default settings, you can modify the ``./src/eventsources/http.yaml` For customisation and using advanced features please **checkout the [express-as-http](../event-sources/event-source-plugins/Express%20Http%20Eventsource) plugin**

### Installation

Godspeed CLI is the command center of a Godspeed project. It allows you to create & manage your Godspeed project. It is shipped via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@godspeedsystems/godspeed). You can go ahead and install it using the below command.


```bash
   npm install -g @godspeedsystems/godspeed
```

_To know more about all CLI commands, [click here](../CLI#supported-commands--arguments)_



### Creating your project
You can create a new project like this.
```bash
  godspeed create <project_name>
```
> This may take some time to install the required npm plugins and create your project. Be patient!

### Building and running your project

**Building** You can build your project using the `godspeed build` command. This transpiles the TS files and copies all the source code into `/dist` folder of your project.

**Clean**  With `godspeed clean` you can remove all pre-compiled files from your `/dist` folder. While build overrides `dist` everytime, `clean` command is useful if you have deleted some files in your `src` repo. When you delete something from `src`, it doesn't delete the files in the `dist`. You may need to clean up the dist folder to remove old references to deleted files in `src`

**Local development in auto-watch mode** You can start your server on localhost using `godspeed serve`. It will run the project in autowatch mode over your local file changes.

**Production deployment:** Build your project and then run `godspeed preview` to serve directly from the `dist` folder 

#### Scaffolding of a meta-framework project
This will create a basic project with Express eventsource, a sample endpoint (event) and event handler function for the same. It will show you possible configurations of Express service with JWT authn and autorization workflows.

- The framework generates different folders like [config](/docs/microservices-framework/config-and-mappings/config.md),[datasources](/docs/microservices-framework/datasources/overview.md) , [events](/docs/microservices-framework/event-sources/event-schema.md), [eventsources](/docs/microservices-framework/event-sources/overview.md), [functions](/docs/microservices-framework/workflows/overview.md), [mappings](/docs/microservices-framework/config-and-mappings/mappings.md), [plugins](/docs/microservices-framework/inline-scripting/script-plugins.md),etc
- The `eslintrc.json` file includes a curated list of recommended plugins that can be incorporated into the project.
- We configure [swagger specs](/docs/microservices-framework/event-sources/event-types/http-events.md#swagger-specs) in src/eventsources/http.yaml

### Referencing pre-made project templates
Pre-made projects are a great place to start learning about the meta-framework. You can refer these pre-made examples to learn about different features of meta-framework, and reuse the code from there. Feel free to clone, refer and re-use the repos given below.

#### Basic Project

Repository - [Hello World](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-node-templates/tree/master/hello_world)

#### Full Stack App
A full stack app with Godspeed based backend and an embedded React project for frontend.

Repository - [With Godspeed and React](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-node-templates/tree/master/FullStack_App_With_React).

#### Loan Origination System

A more complex fintech project with diverse use cases for issuing loans via multiple lenders, policies, loan offers, KYC, loan account creation etc in a microservice based design.

Repository - [Loan Origination System](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-node-templates/tree/master/LOS). 

_Check the Readme.md and Setup.md files in this repo as it requires a docker container of Postgres and Kafka to be running. Dockerfile is provided in the project._
