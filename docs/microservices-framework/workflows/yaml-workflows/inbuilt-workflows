# Built-in functions

**The framework comes equipped with the following built-in functions.**

## Godspeed Built-in functions
The Godspeed framework offers a robust set of built-in functions to empower developers in orchestrating workflows seamlessly. Some of these essential functions include  ["com.gs.parallel"](#comgsparallel) enabling the execution of tasks in a sequential or parallel manner, respectively. For conditional logic, the framework provides ["com.gs.switch"](#comgsswitch), ["com.gs.if"](#comgsif) functions to make decisions based on specific criteria. Developers can iterate through tasks with ["com.gs.each_sequential"](#comgseach_sequential) and ["com.gs.each_parallel"](#comgseach_parallel) for controlled repetition. To capture and communicate data between tasks, ["com.gs.return"](#comgsreturn) comes in handy, while ["com.gs.log"](#comgslog) aids in logging crucial information for monitoring and debugging purposes. These built-in functions collectively enhance the efficiency and flexibility of workflow automation within the Godspeed framework.

### com.gs.transform
This function enables you to convert data from one format to another using CoffeeScript or JavaScript scripting.   
See below a sample workflow:
> The first task is doing the transformation and giving 'Hello' as output.   
> The second task is doing the transformation (concatenation of the output of the first task with query params of the request).

<details>
<summary>Example event for transform function</summary>

```yaml
  http.get./transform:
  fn: transform
  params:
  - name: name
    in: query # same as open api spec: one of cookie, path, query, header
    required: true
    allow_empty_value: false
    schema:
      type: string 
  responses:
    200:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: string
```
</details>

```yaml title='Example 1'
summary: This function returns the greet message with name provided in query parameters
tasks:
  - id: hello_task1
    fn: com.gs.transform
    args: 'Hello'

  - id: transform_result
    fn: com.gs.transform 
    args: <% outputs.hello_task1.data + inputs.query.name %>

Output:
  code: 200
  success: true
  data: "Hello <inputs.query.name>"   
```

This functions always return [GSStatus](../native-language-functions.md/#gsstatus). Please check [response handling](../native-language-functions.md/#handling-event-handler-return) to know how `com.gs.transform` args are transformed as GSStatus.    
The above example doesn't qualify as GSStatus so the framework adds `code: 200` and `success: true` in the response. Check out various examples given below:

```yaml title='Example 2'
summary: This function returns data present in the args
# these args qualifies as GSStatus. The framework ignores the extra 
# keys because data key is already present in the args.
tasks:
  - id: first_task
    fn: com.gs.transform
    args: 
      code: 400
      success: false
      data: "Invalid input error"
      key1: "E001"
      key2: "E002"
      headers: 
        title: "MS1"

Output:
  code: 400
  success: false
  data: "Invalid input error"
  headers: 
    title: "MS1"  
```

```yaml title='Example 3'
summary: This function returns all the keys present in the args 
# as GSStatus.data as there is no data key defined.
# These args don't qualify as GSStatus
tasks:
  - id: first_task
    fn: com.gs.transform
    args: 
      key1: "E001"
      key2: "E002"

Output:
  code: 200
  success: true
  data: 
    key1: "E001"
    key2: "E002" 
```

### com.gs.parallel
:::tip control flow function
Executes the child tasks in parallel.
:::

Parallel execution of tasks involves running multiple tasks simultaneously, leveraging concurrency to enhance efficiency, reduce processing time, and maximize resource utilization in a system or function.In this cases we choose parallel inbuilt function


#### Example event for parallel inbuilt function

<details>
<summary>Example event for parallel inbuilt function</summary>

```yaml
  http.get./test/parallel:
  summary: parallel
  description: executing tasks parallelly
  fn: parallel
  body:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          type: object
  responses:

      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
```
</details>


The above event will trigger the below function

#### Example function for parallel ( parallel.yaml )

```yaml
  summary: The Parallel function runs all its child task in parallel and we can select the specific childs output
  tasks:
    - id: parallel
      fn: com.gs.parallel
      tasks:
        - id: 1st
          fn: com.gs.return
          args: "నమస్కారం"

        - id: 2nd
          fn: com.gs.return
          args: "नमस्ते"

        - id: 3rd
          fn: com.gs.return
          args: "Hello"

    - id: step2
      fn: com.gs.return
      args: |
        <% outputs["1st"] %>
```

### com.gs.switch
:::tip control flow function
The classic switch-case flow execution
:::

The `switch-flow` function accepts two arguments: `value` and `cases`. The `value` parameter receives a CoffeeScript/JavaScript expression that is evaluated at runtime. Each case corresponds to a task, which can trigger the execution of another function or workflow.


#### Example event for switch inbuilt function

<details>
<summary>Example event for switch inbuilt function</summary>

  responses:
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          type: object
```
</details>



The above event will trigger the below function. 

#### Example function for switch ( switch.yaml )


```yaml
summary: A "switch" statement activates specific cases when its conditional value matches any of those cases.
id: switch
description: 
tasks:
  - id: step1
    fn: com.gs.switch
    value: <%inputs.body.condition%>
    cases:
      FIRST:
        id: 1st
        fn: com.gs.return
        args: "sukumar"
      SECOND:
        id: 2nd
        fn: com.gs.return
        args: "yaswanth"
      THIRD:
        id: 3rd
        fn: com.gs.return
        args: "pavan"
    defaults:
      id: default
      fn: com.gs.return
      args: <%"all"%> 

```


### com.gs.each_sequential

:::tip control flow function
The classic for-each flow execution
:::

The `args` parameter consists of a list of values within the `value` field, each paired with its associated task. For every value in the `value` list, tasks are executed one after the other in sequence. The resulting output, `each_sequential`, is an array containing the status of the last task executed in each iteration.

      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: number

```
</details>


#### Example function using each_sequential ( each_sequential.yaml )

```yaml
  summary: For each sample
  description: Here we transform the response of for loop
  tasks:
    - id: each_sequential_step1
      description: for each
      fn: com.gs.each_sequential
      value: [1, 2, 3, 4]
      tasks:
        - id: each_task1
          fn: com.gs.transform
          args: <% inputs.body.number * task_value %>
    - id: each_sequential_step2
      description: return the response
      fn: com.gs.transform
      args: <% outputs.each_sequential_step1.data %>
```


#### Error handling in each_sequential functions

You have the option to include "on_error" at both the task level and within the "each_sequential" loop.

```yaml
  summary: For each sample
  description: Here we transform the response of for loop
  tasks:
    - id: each_sequential_step1
      description: for each
      fn: com.gs.each_sequential
      value: [1, 2, 3, 4]
      tasks:
        - id: each_task1
          fn: com.gs.transform
          args: <% 'each_task1 ' + task_value %>
          on_error: # on_error at task level
            continue: false
            response: <%Coffee/JS expression%> | String
      on_error: # on_error at loop level
        continue: true
        response: <%Coffee/JS expression%> | String
    - id: each_sequential_step2
      description: return the response
      fn: com.gs.transform
      args: <% outputs.each_sequential_step1 %>
```

Consider the above example:
- In the event of a task failure for any task_value, the control is transferred to the "on_error" specified at the task level. If "continue" is set to false, it interrupts the loop; otherwise, it proceeds to the next tasks.
- If all tasks fail within the loop, control shifts to the "on_error" specified at the loop level.

:::note
on_error at loop level only gets executed when all the tasks are failed. If even one task gets successful then it won't get executed.
:::


### com.gs.each_parallel

The `args` parameter comprises a list of values in the `value` field, each paired with its respective tasks. These tasks run concurrently for each value in the `value` list. The resulting output, `each_parallel`, is an array containing the status of the last task executed in each iteration.

#### Example function using each_parallel ( each_parallel.yaml )

```yaml
  summary: For each sample

    - id: each_parallel_step1
      description: for each

    - id: each_parallel_step2
      description: return the response
      fn: com.gs.transform
      args: <% outputs.each_parallel_step1 %>
```


#### Error handling in each_parallel

You have the option to include "on_error" at both the task level and within each parallel loop.

```yaml
  summary: For each sample
  description: Here we transform the response of for loop
  tasks:
    - id: each_parallel_step1
      description: for each
      fn: com.gs.each_parallel
      value: [1, 2, 3, 4]
      tasks:
        - id: each_task1
          fn: com.gs.transform
          args: <% 'each_task1 ' + task_value %>
          on_error: # on_error at task level
            continue: false
            response: <%Coffee/JS expression%> | String
        - id: each_task2
          fn: com.gs.transform
          args: <% 'each_task2 ' + task_value %>
      on_error: # on_error at loop level
        continue: true
        response: <%Coffee/JS expression%> | String
    - id: each_parallel_step2
      description: return the response
      fn: com.gs.transform
      args: <% outputs.each_parallel_step1 %>
```

Consider the above example:
- If a task fails for any task_value, control is directed to the "on_error" defined at the task level. If "continue" is set to false, it interrupts the execution for the subsequent tasks in the `tasks` section for the current `task_value` in the `value` list. For instance, in the provided workflow, if the `each_task1` step of `task_value` 1 fails, the `each_task2` won't be executed when "continue" is set to false.
- If all tasks fail within the loop, control shifts to the "on_error" specified at the loop level.

:::note
The "on_error" at the loop level is only executed when all tasks fail. If even one task is successful, it won't be executed.
:::



### com.gs.return

:::tip return statement
The classic return statement
:::

Return statement, in any programming language, ends the execution of a function and returns the control to the function from where it was called.   
Similarly, when the `com.gs.return` function is used, it causes the current function to exit and returns control to the calling function/workflow, effectively terminating the function's execution.

:::note[Important]
This function does the transformation in the same way as [com.gs.transform](#comgstransform) except that it terminates the current function's execution.
:::

<summary>Example event for return inbuilt function</summary>

```yaml
  http.post./return-fn/:city:
  fn: return
```
</details>

```yaml title='Example 1'
summary: This function returns only the 'Hello' string 
# and causes the function to exit from task1.
tasks:
  - id: hello_task1
    fn: com.gs.return
    args: 
      code: 200
      success: true
      data: "Hello"

  - id: transform_result
    fn: com.gs.transform 
    args: <% outputs.hello_task1.data + inputs.query.name %>

Output:
  code: 200
  success: true
  data: "Hello"   
```

:::infoexception
com.gs.return doesn't immediately return when used inside [com.gs.parallel](#comgsparallel) function. On the contrary, the output of all the parallel tasks is returned as given in the below example:
```yaml
summary: return from com.gs.parallel
tasks:
- id: step1
    fn: com.gs.parallel
    tasks:
      - id: 1st
        fn: com.gs.return
        args: "hello"
      - id: 2nd
        fn: com.gs.return
        args: "nice"
      - id: 3rd
        fn: com.gs.return
        args: "world"       
```
Output:
```json
[
    {
        "code": 200,
        "success": true,
        "data": "hello"
    },
    {
        "code": 200,
        "success": true,
        "data": "nice"
    },
    {
        "code": 200,
        "success": true,
        "data": "world"
    }
]
```
:::

### com.gs.log
During the workflow execution, it records intermediate inputs and outputs in the Pino logging format. The parameters include `level`, which can be set to any value from the [Pino log levels](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/api.md#options), and `data`, which accepts a CoffeeScript/JavaScript expression to be evaluated at runtime or any other data type, such as a string or number, that you wish to log.

    args: <js% (outputs.sum_step1) %>
```

### com.gs.if
:::tip control flow function
The classic if-else flow execution
:::

The function takes two parameters: `condition` and `tasks`. The `condition` parameter accepts a CoffeeScript/JavaScript expression that is evaluated at runtime, while the `tasks` parameter can trigger the execution of either another function or a workflow.

### Using on_error

You have the flexibility to define "on_error" at both the workflow level and the task level based on your specific needs. Refer to the following section for more detailed information. [know more](/docs/microservices-framework/workflows/yaml-workflows/workflow-dsl.md#error-handling)

**1. Workflow level on_error handling**

**2. Task level on_error handling**

:::note
The `on_error` handler at the loop level is triggered exclusively when all tasks within the loop have failed. If at least one task within the loop succeeds, this handler will not be executed.
:::

#### Example for workflow level error handling

```yaml
summary: calling the thirdparty api with headers to check on error
description: testing on_error in workflow level with custom message
on_error:
  response:
    success: false
    code: 500
    data: 'Workflow is broken, returned custom response'  
tasks:
    - id: on_error_at_workflow_04
      fn: datasource.api.get./profile
      args:
        headers:
          Content-Type: application/json
          x-hasura-admin-secret: <% inputs.headers['auth'] %>
          x-hasura-role: <% inputs.headers['role'] %>
          x-hasura-user-id: <% inputs.headers['id'] %>
```
If the `on_error` is not specified at the task level in the above workflow, but it is defined at the workflow level, then in the event of any task failure, the workflow-level `on_error` will be activated, returning a specified custom response.


#### Example for task level error handling

```yaml
summary: Testing on_error at task level
tasks:
  - id: task_level_1 
    fn: com.gs.transform # if we use this args in transform function they will set as response 
    args: 
      success: false
      code: 500
      data: "task 1 executed"
    on_error: 
      continue: false 
      response:
        code: 400
        data: "error occured"
    
  - id: task_level_2
    fn: com.gs.return
    args: "task 2 executed"
```
In the given example, error handling is implemented at the task level, and it activates when a specific task fails. The `continue` variable, which is true by default, determines whether to proceed with the next task in case of a failure. If `continue` is set to true, the subsequent workflow will be executed. If set to false, the current task exits with a custom response specified in the `on_error`.


**When both task-level and workflow-level `on_error` are specified, any error occurring in the tasks will trigger the task-level `on_error`, thereby overriding the `on_error` specified at the workflow level.**

#### Special case on error

```yaml
summary: testing tsaks within workflow
tasks:
  - id: task_level_1 
    fn: com.gs.transform 
    args: 
      success: false # if we use this args in transform function they will set as response 
      code: 500
      data: "task 1 executed"
    on_error: 
      continue: true 
      tasks:  
        - id: on_error_task1
          fn: com.gs.transform
          args: 
            code: 400
            data: "on error task 1 executed"
    
  - id: task_level_2
    fn: com.gs.return
    args: <% outputs.task_level_1 %> 
```

In the given example, instead of specifying a custom response in `on_error` for tasks, we include tasks directly. This approach proves beneficial when additional functions need to be performed in the event of a task failure.
