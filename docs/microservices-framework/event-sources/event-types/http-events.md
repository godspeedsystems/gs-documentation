# HTTP events

In Godspeed, sync APIs are created as HTTP events. Each API endpoint is essentially an event configured to listen for HTTP requests and respond accordingly. HTTP events accept inputs such as body, headers, path parameters, and query parameters. 

### HTTP Event Schema

- The framework provides request and response schema validation out of the box.
- To switch between events, you'll need to adjust the event schema based on the expected inputs. For instance,

This event schema is supported by [HTTP express eventsource](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-plugins/tree/main/plugins/express-as-http#godspeed-express-plugin)

```yaml
http.post./mongo/user/search/{id}: #This is the only thing that changes across all the events
  summary: Update a user # as per Swagger spec
  description: Update user from database # as per Swagger spec
  fn: com.biz.mongo.user.update # function to be invoked
  on_validation_error: com.jfs.handle_validation_error
  params: # params as per Swagger spec
    - name: id
      in: path
      required: true
      schema:
        type: string
    - name: name
      in: query
      required: false
      schema:
        type: string
  body: #as per Swagger spec
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/definitions/mongo/BusinessProfile" #defined for definition section.
  responses: #as per Swagger spec
    200:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: object
    500:
      content:
        application/json:
          schema:
            type: string
```

- The event's first line comprises three key elements: the type of eventsource (e.g., `http`), the method (e.g., `put`), and the URL (`/mongo/user/{id}`). This format is defined by the eventsource plugin, and it is the only line that changes across all events.

#### Accessing Event Properties in Workflows

For an HTTP event, the headers, query, params and body data are captured in a standard format, and made available in the `inputs` object [for use in the workflows](/docs/microservices-framework/workflows/overview.md).

The inputs (event) object has following properties:
If you have jwt authentication like strategy implemented, then

- **past user object can be accessed as**:`<%inputs.user%>`

- **query can be accessed as**: `<%inputs.query.var_name%>` Present in case of http events

- **params can be accessed as**: `<%inputs.params.path_param%>` Present in case of http events

- **headers can be accessed as**: `<%inputs.headers.some_header_key%>` Present in case of http events

- **body can be accessed as**: `<%inputs.body.key%>` Present for all events except for http events which don't have a body. For ex. http.get

- **files can be accessed as**: `<%inputs.files%>` Any files uploaded via HTTP event. Not present in other kind of events

### Swagger Specs

Framework will give you below folder structure.

```
    .
    ├── src
        ├── datasources
        │   ├── types
        │   |    └── axios.ts
        |   |
        │   └── api.yaml
        │
        ├── events
        |   |
        │   └── helloworld.yaml
        |
        ├── eventsources
        │   ├── types
        │   |    └── express.ts
        |   |
        │   └── http.yaml
        |
        └── functions
            |
            └── helloworld.yaml
```

1. Swagger ui is enabled automatically through adding `docs` in **"./src/eventsources/http.yaml"**

2. `/` is the default endpoint,if you want to provide your custom swagger endpoint, you can modify the endpoint from **"./src/eventsources/http.yaml"**

#### Update http.yaml( src/eventsources/http.yaml )

```yaml
type: express
port: 3000
base_url: /api/v1
docs:
  endpoint: /
```

:::tip note
Both [express](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-plugins/blob/main/plugins/express-as-http/README.md) and [fastify](https://github.com/godspeedsystems/gs-plugins/tree/main/plugins/fastify-as-http) plugins support this format of configuration to setup swagger
:::

#### Custom server URL and custom Info:

In the `http.yaml` file, you have the option to incorporate a custom server URL for API documentation. By including this custom server URL, any autogenerated documentation or Swagger specifications will feature this URL within the `servers` section. Additionally, you can enhance the documentation by specifying a custom `title`, `version`, and `contact information` through the addition of `info`.

```yaml
type: express
port: 3000
base_url: /api/v1
docs:
  endpoint: /
  info:
    version: 0.0.1
    title: "Godspeed: Sample Microservice"
