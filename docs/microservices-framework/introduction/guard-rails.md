# GuardRails 

Guardrails in the context of software development refer to a set of predefined rules, best practices, and constraints that guide developers in creating code that is secure, efficient, and maintainable. 

At Godspeed, our development philosophy revolves around four core guardrails, shaping a robust and innovative approach to software creation:

### 1.Schema driven development:

Embracing the power of structured data, Godspeed follows a schema-driven development approach. This guardrail ensures that the events, workflows within the software are defined by clear and well-documented schemas. 

Dive deeper into the fascinating world of schema-driven development by watching the video below...

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden' }}>
<iframe style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }} src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jtn8rvfs7lo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


### 2.Configure over code:

At Godspeed, we believe in empowerment over complexity. That's why we champion configuration over endless coding. This guardrail encourages the use of high-level abstractions and configuration settings, giving developers the power to tailor the software's behavior without getting lost in the weeds of complex code changes.

Ready to unravel the magic of configure over code? Take a closer look in the video below, where we break it down in simple terms!"

### 3.Security:

At Godspeed, security is non-negotiable. We've fortified our software with robust security standards and practices, including secure coding, strong authentication, and proactive vulnerability mitigation.

### 4. Decoupled Architecture:

Godspeed's guardrail of decoupled architecture advocates for the separation of concerns within the software. By modularizing components and minimizing dependencies, this approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and collaboration among development teams. 

Watch the below video for more understanding.
