# Handle Callbacks in Godspeed
Handling callbacks in your application just requires setting up an **HTTP endpoint**.

This endpoint will act as a listener for responses from third-party services, which send data or notifications to your server when specific events occur.

### Steps to Handle Callbacks in Godspeed

### 1. Define the Callback URL Endpoint

To receive a callback, define an **HTTP endpoint** in Godspeed that the third-party service can use as the callback URL.

1. **Create a New Event** in the `src/events` directory. This event will listen for incoming callback requests.

Example **`callback-event.yaml`**:

  ```yaml
   http.post./callback:
     summary: "Handle callbacks from external services"
     description: "Endpoint to handle callback responses from external services."
     fn: handleCallback
     authn: false
     body:
       content:
         application/json:
           schema:
             type: object
             properties:
               status:
                 type: string
               data:
                 type: object
             required: [status]
     responses:
       200:
         description: Callback handled successfully
         content:
           application/json:
             schema:
               type: object
               properties:
                 message:
                   type: string
                   example: Callback received and processed
       400:
         description: Invalid callback request
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **Path**: The callback endpoint listens at `POST /callback`.
   - **Body**: Defines the structure of the callback payload (e.g., `status` and `data` fields).
   - **Responses**: Specifies possible responses, such as `200` for successful processing and `400` for invalid requests.

### 2. Create the Workflow to Process the Callback

Define a workflow to process the callback data, handling any necessary business logic.

1. **Create a Workflow File** in the `src/functions` directory to define how the callback data is processed.

Example **`handleCallback.yaml`**:

   ```yaml
   id: handleCallback
   summary: Process callback data from external service
   tasks:
     - id: validate_callback
       fn: validateCallbackData
       args:
         data: <% inputs.body.data %>
         status: <% inputs.body.status %>

     - id: process_data
       fn: processData
       args:
         data: <% validate_callback.result %>

     - id: respond_success
       args:
         statusCode: 200
         body:
           message: Callback received and processed successfully
   ```

   **Explanation**:
   - **validate_callback**: A task to validate incoming callback data.
   - **process_data**: Processes the data after validation.
   - **respond_success**: Responds with a `200` status code if all tasks are completed successfully.

### 3. Set the Callback URL with the Third-Party Service

1. **Register the Callback URL** with the external service.
   - Provide the callback URL in the following format: `http://<BASE_URL>:<PORT>/callback`
   - Replace `<BASE_URL>` and `<PORT>` with your actual server's URL and port.

   For example:
   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:3000/callback
   ```

2. **Test the Callback**:
   - Use tools like **Postman** or a similar HTTP client to simulate a POST request to the `/callback` endpoint.
   - Ensure the payload matches the expected schema to confirm the callback flow.

### Example Scenario: Handling Payment Gateway Callback

Let’s say you’re integrating with a payment gateway, and you want to handle a payment status update callback:

1. **Set Up Event and Workflow**: Follow the same steps as above to create the event (`payment_callback.yaml`) and workflow (`handlePaymentCallback`) files.
2. **Register the Callback URL**: Provide the payment gateway with your callback URL.
3. **Process the Callback**: In the `handlePaymentCallback` workflow, define specific tasks to validate payment status, log transactions, or update your database based on the callback data.

---

This setup gives you full control over handling incoming callbacks, allowing you to process and store data as required. Each component—from the event to the functions—can be customized to suit the specific needs of the callback use case.
