title: 8.4 Datastore as datasource
---

# Introduction
The framework takes the approach of schema driven development. 
It supports multiple kinds of SQL and NoSQL datastores. The developer only needs to specify or generate the schema for a datastore, with authorization policies. The CRUD events and workflows are automatically generated from the schema itself. Shall the developer need to use these within other workflows, they can do that as well.

**Currently supported datastores** 

- Postgres (via Prisma)
- Mysql (via Prisma)
- Mongodb (via Prisma)
- Elasticsearch (via Elasticgraph, our inhouse implementation providing bunch of exciting features over Elasticsearch, including relationship management and joins.)

**The integration supports**
- Model declaration (For both relational and non-relational stores)
- Schema generation from existing database
- Universal, autogenerated CRUD API.
- Validation of the CRUD requests
- Authorization mechanism at the entity, column, row and ownership levels
- Automatic caching based on configuration.

## 8.4.1 Schema specification

The framework extends [Prisma specification](http://prisma.io) for specifying the schema of any datastore. This can be generated from an [existing database](#732-cli-commands) or manually created by the developer. The schema is present as `{datastore_name}.prisma` file in the `src/datasources` folder.

** Sample Schema **
```
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated-clients/mongo"
  previewFeatures = ["metrics"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("MONGO_TEST_URL")
}

model User1 {
  id        String      @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique
  name      String?
}
```

## 8.4.2 CLI Commands
Any [Prisma CLI command](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-cli) can be executed from godspeed CLI using `godspeed prisma <command>`. For example,
```
$ godspeed prisma db pull --schema=./src/datasources/mongo_pull.prisma 
                      _                                   _ 
   __ _    ___     __| |  ___   _ __     ___    ___    __| |
  / _` |  / _ \   / _` | / __| | '_ \   / _ \  / _ \  / _` |
 | (_| | | (_) | | (_| | \__ \ | |_) | |  __/ |  __/ | (_| |
  \__, |  \___/   \__,_| |___/ | .__/   \___|  \___|  \__,_|
  |___/                        |_|                          
Prisma schema loaded from src/datasources/mongo_pull.prisma
Environment variables loaded from .env
Datasource "db"

✔ Introspected 6 models and wrote them into src/datasources/mongo_pull.prisma in 81ms
      
*** WARNING ***

Could not determine the types for the following fields.
- Model "Post", field: "slug"
- Model "Profile", field: "userId"
- Model "User", field: "email"

Run prisma generate to generate Prisma Client.
```

:::note
Please make sure that `godspeed prisma <command>` is executed inside from devcontainer/project root directory.

## 8.4.3 Prisma Datastore Setup
The framework has [inbuilt feature](../setup/auto-watch.md/#auto-watch-and-build) of setting up datastore automatically whenever a new `{datastore_name}.prisma` file is created in the `src/datasources` folder. In case, you are getting any error in the datastore setup, then you can refer to below section for manual setup: 

> During the project setup, if you have not specified the type of datastore you just added, then you will have to execute `godspeed update` in project root directory, outside the dev container. This will deploy the container for this datastore in the dev container environment.

### Model setup
Prisma model setup is done using prisma generate and db push commands.

#### Step 1: godspeed prisma generate
```
$ godspeed prisma generate --schema=./src/datasources/mongo2.prisma 
                      _                                   _ 
   __ _    ___     __| |  ___   _ __     ___    ___    __| |
  / _` |  / _ \   / _` | / __| | '_ \   / _ \  / _ \  / _` |
 | (_| | | (_) | | (_| | \__ \ | |_) | |  __/ |  __/ | (_| |
  \__, |  \___/   \__,_| |___/ | .__/   \___|  \___|  \__,_|
  |___/                        |_|                          
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from src/datasources/mongo2.prisma

✔ Generated Prisma Client (3.15.2 | library) to ./src/datasources/generated-clients/mongo2 in 111ms
You can now start using Prisma Client in your code. Reference: https://pris.ly/d/client

import { PrismaClient } from './src/datasources/generated-clients/mongo2'
const prisma = new PrismaClient()
```

#### Step 2: godspeed prisma db push
```
$ godspeed prisma db push --schema=./src/datasources/mongo.prisma 
                      _                                   _ 
   __ _    ___     __| |  ___   _ __     ___    ___    __| |
  / _` |  / _ \   / _` | / __| | '_ \   / _ \  / _ \  / _` |
 | (_| | | (_) | | (_| | \__ \ | |_) | |  __/ |  __/ | (_| |
  \__, |  \___/   \__,_| |___/ | .__/   \___|  \___|  \__,_|
  |___/                        |_|                          
Environment variables loaded from .env
Prisma schema loaded from src/datasources/mongo.prisma
Datasource "db"

The database is already in sync with the Prisma schema.

✔ Generated Prisma Client (3.15.2 | library) to ./src/datasources/generated-clients/mongo in 149ms
```

## 8.4.4 Auto generating CRUD APIs from data store models
Developer can generate CRUD APIs for all the models in a datastore. `Events` and `Workflows` will be auto generated for `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete` operations for each model in respective datastore.

 Auto-generated events and workflows will be stored in `/events/{datasourceName}/{modelName}` and `/functions/com/gs/{datasourceName}/{modelName}` folders respectively.

```
godspeed gen-crud-api
```

## 8.4.5 Sample datastore CRUD task
Please find an [example here](../workflows#763-comgsdatastore)

## 8.4.6 Prisma encryption of fields
You can apply encryption on `String` type fields in Prisma. Be default, the encryption algorithm used is AES-GCM with 256 bit keys.  

### 8.4.6.1 Specification
In your prisma schema, add `/// @encrypted` to the fields you want to encrypts.   
For example, `email` field in below schema:
```
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
  output   = "./generated-clients/mongo"
  previewFeatures = ["metrics"]
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("MONGO_TEST_URL")
}

model User1 {
  id        String      @id @default(auto()) @map("_id") @db.ObjectId
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  email     String   @unique /// @encrypted
  name      String?
}
```

### 8.4.6.2 Configuration
You can specify `prisma_secret` in [environment configuration](../setup/configuration/env-vars.md/#custom-environment-variablesyaml)   
For example, this is the sample configuration, set `PRISMA_SECRET` as env variable:
```yaml
prisma_secret: PRISMA_SECRET # secret used to generate hash of prisma fields
```

export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '0px',
      color: 'black',
      padding: '5px',
      cursor: 'pointer',
    }}
   >
    {children}
  </span>
);
